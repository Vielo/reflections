When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'd want to use the remote repository when there's more people working on the project, so the local repo simply would not suffice.
It would also help if I were to do any work on the project from another computer, i.e. switching between a work and home PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I believe it's because you might not always want to automatically update stuff you are working on. It could introduce lots of chaos and would take away any kind of control over the project. Doing it manually also enables the user to actually select the branch they want to work on.
